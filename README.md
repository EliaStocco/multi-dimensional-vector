# multi-dimensional-vector
A single include c++ template class for multi dimensional dynamical vectors

## Jupyter Notebooks
Some jupyter notebooks for Cling kernel are also provided. 
If you do not have Cling or Xeus-Cling kernel installed (https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling.git) you can open it online with Binder (https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling/stable?filepath=notebooks/xcpp.ipynb)

The provided jupyter notebooks are for demonstration only:
- dynamical-vector.ipynb is my "working file", here I modify the code and save it automatically to all the header files
- test.ipynb is a notebook where I test if the code works correctly, you can open it with binder or with github in order to see how to use the template class, copy line of code, etc

## Header files
The only file to be included in your project is "dynamics-vector.h", but you alse need to have "header/" directory in the same directory of "dynamics-vector.h"
