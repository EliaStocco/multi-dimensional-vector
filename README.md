A single include c++ template class for multi dimensional dynamical vectors

A jupyter notebook for Cling kernel is also provided. If you do not have Cling or Xeus-Cling installed (https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling.git) you can open it online with Binder (https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling/stable?filepath=notebooks/xcpp.ipynb)

The provided jupyter notebook is for demonstration only. The only file to be included in your project is "dynamics-vector.h" in "header/" directory
